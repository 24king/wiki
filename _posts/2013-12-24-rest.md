# Basic Concepts#
1. resource 资源
1. uniform interface 统一接口
1. user interface 用户接口
1. user state 用户状态
1. client context 客户程序上下文
1. make the transition to a new state 状态迁
1. *representation* of each application state
 


# Constranints #

## client-server ##
a uniform interface separates clients from servers.

## stateless ##

	no client context being stored on the server between requests.
	--> where is --> 
	the representation of each application state contains links that may be used the
	next time the client choose to initiate a new state-transition.
	--> so
	the client begins sending requests when it is ready to make the transition to a
	new state.


## cacheable ##
	client can cache responses.
	responses must therefore, implicitly or explicitly,define themselves as
	cacheable, or not, to prevent clients reusing stale or inappropriate data in
	response to further requests.

## Layered system ##
	A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected driectly to the end
	server or to an intermediary along the way.

## code on demand(optional) ##
	servers can termporararily extend or customize the functionality of a client by
	the transfer of executable code.
